# Technook ML Development Internship - Task 3
Congratulations on completing the third task of the Technook ML Development Internship! This task involved completing three machine learning projects: Diabetes Prediction, Classify Iris Prediction, and Wine Quality Prediction.
 
# Projects
1. Diabetes Prediction
Technologies Used:
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Scikit-learn
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
# Description:
The Diabetes Prediction project is a machine learning model designed to predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on relevant health indicators. The project utilizes the Scikit-learn library for model development and Pandas for data manipulation.

# Instructions for Testing:
Clone the repository.
Open the Jupyter Notebook file (diabetes_prediction.ipynb) in an environment that supports Python and Jupyter Notebooks.
Follow the provided instructions to test the diabetes prediction model.
2. Classify Iris Prediction
# Technologies Used:
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Scikit-learn
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
# Description:
The Classify Iris Prediction project involves building a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into different species based on features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Scikit-learn is used for model development and data visualization.

Instructions for Testing:
Clone the repository.
Open the Jupyter Notebook file (classify_iris_prediction.ipynb) in an environment that supports Python and Jupyter Notebooks.
Follow the provided instructions to test the iris classification model.
3. Wine Quality Prediction
# Technologies Used:
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Scikit-learn
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
# Description:
The Wine Quality Prediction project focuses on predicting the quality of wines based on various features. The machine learning model is built using Scikit-learn, and Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis.

Instructions for Testing:
Clone the repository.
Open the Jupyter Notebook file (wine_quality_prediction.ipynb) in an environment that supports Python and Jupyter Notebooks.
Follow the provided instructions to test the wine quality prediction model.
Additional Notes
Include any additional notes, dependencies, or specific instructions for running the projects. If there are specific datasets used, provide information on where to obtain them.
